AS A social media startup project,
This is an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description 

VS Code was used to write the website's code. 

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
